            MS Dhoni probably ranks as the third-most popular Indian cricketer ever, behind only 
            Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He emerged from a cricketing backwater, the eastern 
            Indian state of Jharkhand, and made it to the top with a home-made batting and 
            wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled the highs and hit the 
            lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy.<br><br>

            Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the top prize in all formats: leading the Test 
            rankings for 18 months starting December 2009, winning the 50-over World Cup in 2011, 
            and the T20 world title on his captaincy debut in 2007.<br><br>

            He seemingly emerged fully formed at 23, when he blasted two centuries in a triangular
             50-over tournament for India A in Nairobi. Long-haired and fearless, he soon swaggered 
             into international cricket, and became an instant darling of the crowds with ODI 
             innings of 148 and 183 not out within a year of his debut.<br><br>

            Dhoni improvised abd learned, but he didn't apologise for his batting style, which was 
            not the most elegant. He became a multifaceted ODI batter, one who could accumulate, 
            rebuild, and unleash big sixes, all seemingly at will.<br><br>

            Along the way he showed leadership skills, which were recognised when Rahul Dravid gave 
            up the captaincy in 2007. A day before that announcement from Dravid, a young India side 
            under Dhoni played the first game of the first T20 World Cup in South Africa, and went on 
            to win the tournament. The ODI captaincy was a natural progression, and the Test role 
            duly followed too.<br><br>

            Dhoni brought to the captaincy a thick skin and the relative indifference to results 
            that an Indian captain needs to keep the job for long. Along with India's coach, Gary 
            Kirsten, he put his senior performers in a comfortable place, and they repaid him by 
            producing some of their best years in international cricket. Dhoni's sense of calm on 
            the field mostly worked like a charm in the shorter formats, although he sometimes sat 
            back for too long in Tests tactically. Still, India had some of their best years in 
            Test cricket, in terms of tangible achievement, under him: in the 60 Tests he led in, 
            they had a win-loss ratio of 1.5.<br><br>

            However, after the 50-over World Cup win in 2011, which Dhoni sealed with a timely 91 
            and a six off his patented helicopter shot, an ageing team lost eight straight Tests 
            on the trot away from home and his captaincy came under immense pressure, which was 
            then exacerbated by India's first home series loss in eight years, 2-1 to England in 
            2012-13. This brought about a new chapter in Dhoni's career, where he seemed more 
            assertive as a captain, building a new team. He played his best Test innings on a 
            turner to win India the Chennai Test in 2013 against Australia, and became the first 
            captain to lead India to four wins in a Test series.<br><br>

            Away from home in the winter of 2013-14, India lost Test series in South Africa and 
            New Zealand by 1-0 margins that did not reflect how close they came to winning both. 
            The England tour of 2014 began promisingly, with a drawn first Test followed by a 
            historic win at Lord's, but India crashed to earth immediately afterwards to lose the 
            series 3-1. At Old Trafford and The Oval, with the batting crumbling around him, Dhoni 
            played a couple of his bravest innings in Tests.<br><br>

            On the tour of Australia that followed, India competed ferociously, thanks to a young 
            batting core led by Kohli, but it didn't quite show in their results. Dhoni announced 
            after the third Test, in Melbourne, that he was retiring from the format. He ended his 
            career in whites with a proud record for a wicketkeeper: 4876 runs at an average of 
            just over 38, six hundreds, and just under 300 dismissals.<br><br>

            Dhoni continued to lead India in the shorter formats, and they got to the semi-finals 
            of the 2015 World Cup. A year later they won the Asia Cup T20 in Bangladesh but exited 
            the home T20 World Cup in the semi-final, though Dhoni enjoyed a good tournament as a 
            finisher, scoring 89 runs while only being dismissed once in five innings, and showing 
            electric reflexes while keeping to the spinners. He eventually played on till the 2019 
            World Cup (but gave up the white-ball captaincy in January 2017).<br><br>

            India's defeat to New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup turned out to be 
            Dhoni's final international, although that wasn't officially confirmed till more than a 
            year later, when after Covid brought sport to a halt, he announced it on Instagram just 
            as players' preparations for that year's delayed IPL began.<br><br>

            In that tournament, Dhoni has been the face of the Chennai Super Kings franchise, 
            inspiring fierce cult fandom. When Super Kings were reinstated in 2018 after two 
            seasons out serving a suspension, he was back at the helm, leading the team to a 
            fairy-tale third title, and he almost repeated the feat in 2019, when CSK lost a 
            thrilling final against Mumbai Indians by just one run. Dhoni led them to their third 
            title win in 2021, and repeated the feat in 2023, making CSK the league's most 
            successful franchise, alongside Mumbai.<br><br>
